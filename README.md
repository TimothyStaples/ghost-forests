Observational study examining the incursion of seagrass into dead mangrove stands ("ghost forests"). 

ghostForests.R reads in all data, conducts all analyses and produces all figures and tables. To reproduce results, download the entire repository including all sub-folders and set the working directory in the R file as the path to that file.

PENDING: Post-publication I will update this readme with a DOI number to the manuscript and to the PANGEA reference with the structured data archive.
